# Lauren Denomme's Professional Portfolio
A curated portfolio of AI & Machine Learning projects showcasing my ability to develop innovative, end-to-end solutions. This repository highlights my proficiency in building complex deep learning models, including a character-level encoder-decoder RNN for a novel scent recommender system. It serves as a comprehensive look into my work from my Master's in AI & Machine Learning at CSU-G, as well as subsequent independent projects.

# Projects
This portfolio is organized into distinct project folders, each containing code, documentation, and a dedicated README.md file with a detailed explanation of the project's goals, methodology, and outcomes.

**1. Scent Recommender System**
+ **Description:** A capstone project that prototypes a scent recommendation system. It uses a character-level encoder-decoder RNN to take a user's free-text scent description and output a specific product recommendation.
+ **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, NLP

# Skills
+ **Programming Languages:** Python
+ **Deep Learning Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras
+ **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn
+ **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Pandas, NumPy
+ **Core Concepts:** Natural Language Processing (NLP), Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Encoder-Decoder Models
