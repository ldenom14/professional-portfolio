# Lauren Denomme's Professional Portfolio
A curated portfolio of AI & Machine Learning projects showcasing my ability to develop innovative, end-to-end solutions. This repository highlights my proficiency in building complex deep learning models, including my graduate capstone project where I created a character-level encoder-decoder RNN for a novel scent recommender system. It serves as a comprehensive look into my work from my Master's in AI & Machine Learning at Colorado State University Global, as well as subsequent independent projects.

# Projects
This portfolio is organized into distinct project folders, each containing code, documentation, and a dedicated README.md file with a detailed explanation of the project's goals, methodology, and outcomes.

**1. Scent Recommender: A Character-level Encoder-Decoder Model**
+ **Description:** A capstone project that prototypes a scent recommendation system. It uses a character-level encoder-decoder RNN to take a user's free-text scent description and output a specific product recommendation (based on scents from the perfume company, DedCool).
+ **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Gradio, NLP

**2. Computer Vision: Russian License Plate Detector**
+ **Description:** A foundational computer vision project that uses a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier to detect Russian license plates in images. This project demonstrates proficiency in essential image preprocessing techniques and classic object detection pipelines, showcasing skills applicable to autonomous systems and robotics.
+ **Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Haar Cascade Classifiers
